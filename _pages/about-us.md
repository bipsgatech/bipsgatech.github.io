    title: Paloma (Vice President)
    excerpt: "Paloma Casteleiro Costa is a PhD student in the Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy Lab. Her research is on the development and implementation of label free imaging techniques to analyze tissue and biomedical samples. Particularly, her work focuses on implementing a novel phase imaging technique to better detect tumor regions and improve precision during surgery.  
She grew up in La Coruña, Spain, received her BS in telecommunications Engineering from Universistat Politécnica de Valencia and holds a Masters in ECE from Georgia Tech, with a focus in image processing and machine learning. 
When she’s not doing research she enjoys rock climbing, biking, playing guitar, reading, hiking and just spending quality time with others."
