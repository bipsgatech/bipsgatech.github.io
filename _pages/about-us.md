    title: Dylan (President)
    excerpt: "Dylan (Jeonghwan Son) is a Ph.D student at the Wallace H. Coulter department of Biomedical Engineering. His research in Dr. Jia’s Systems Biophotonics group focuses on the development of new multimodality systems of optical fluorescence microscopy to open new biomedical applications, provide clinical translation, and benefit the next generation of scientists. He has been educated as a Biomedical Engineer at Yonsei University (South Korea) and StonyBrook University (NY, USA). He also enjoys playing squash, collecting perfumes, listening to jazz, and touring galleries outside of research."

    title: Paloma (Vice President)
    excerpt: "Paloma Casteleiro Costa is a PhD student in the Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy Lab. Her research is on the development and implementation of label free imaging techniques to analyze tissue and biomedical samples. Particularly, her work focuses on implementing a novel phase imaging technique to better detect tumor regions and improve precision during surgery.  
She grew up in La Coruña, Spain, received her BS in telecommunications Engineering from Universistat Politécnica de Valencia and holds a Masters in ECE from Georgia Tech, with a focus in image processing and machine learning. 
When she’s not doing research she enjoys rock climbing, biking, playing guitar, reading, hiking and just spending quality time with others."

    title: Nischita (Treasurer)
    excerpt: "Nischita is a PhD. student in the Bioengineering program. Her research in the Robles’ lab focuses on phase retrieval techniques for hyperspectral imaging of cells and tissues in the UV region of the spectrum. She is interested in applying concepts from signal processing, machine learning, and convex optimization to develop algorithms and techniques for biomedical image acquisition and processing. Outside of research, she dabbles in art and cooking and is an ardent tennis and soccer fan. "

    excerpt: "Optical technologies have enabled key advances in biology and medicine due to their ability to assess many chemical and physical properties of cells and tissues with great flexibility (e.g., in-vivo, non-invasively, over a wide range of length scales, and over long periods of time). The OIS lab seeks to continue advancing optical technologies to help improve our understanding of biological processes and our ability to identify disease. Specifically, we focus on developing and applying label-free linear and nonlinear spectroscopic methods, along with advanced signal processing methods, to gain access to novel forms of functional and molecular contrast for a variety of applications, including cancer detection, tumor margin assessment, hematology, and neuron functional imaging."
  - image_path: assets/images/shu-jia.png
    title: "Shu Jia"
    excerpt: "Our research is focused on systems biophotonics and imaging technology, such as single-molecule biophotonics, super-resolution microscopy, advanced optical and computational microscopy, imaging physics, biomedical imaging instrumentation and devices, and imaging microrobotics and machine-intelligence. We strive to innovate in ways that both advance the imaging science and also impact biological and translational research. 
    
  Toward the application end, we have expertise in a wide range of imaging instrumentation and techniques, such as super-resolution, adaptive optics, light-field, miniaturized, light-sheet, computational microscopy and endoscopy. Collaboratively, these techniques are expected to address the challenges in 1) mapping functional networks of biological systems from molecules to the whole organ, 2) imaging collective patterns of cellular activities flowing within these networks in freely behaving animals, and 3) integrating and transforming molecular and cellular imaging information into health and disease."
