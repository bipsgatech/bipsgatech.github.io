#Have a hard time on understanding OPTICAL MICROSCOPY?

Diverse optical microscopy systems have enabled interdisciplinary research that facilitates the understanding of a variety of biomedical targets with high speed, high resolution, and in varied environments. However, microscopy users require access to additional resources to gain a better understanding of recent optical microscopy systems and how to use them to aid in answering challenging biological questions. 

BiPS and BBUGS would like to co-host virtual microscopy workshops and/or qualifying exam prep sessions to share our knowledge on optical microscopy. This survey is to assess interest and familiarity with optics to design our events to better cater to your interests and needs.
