BiPS and [BBUGS](https://bbugs.gatech.edu/) would like to co-host virtual microscopy workshops and/or qualifying exam prep sessions to share our knowledge on optical microscopy. This survey is to assess interest and familiarity with optics to design our events to better cater to your interests and needs. 

 
Please take our short [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTlYQRCFOhuHpfr9MdH-v1RMtRI5e2gdpm3mkezbyeksj_2Q/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0HR3E2cdGBfG38B-3XvI79dCQ99ZCAp0AUdrfSewvjmhzpudug1qu1Wco).
