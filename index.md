BiPS (Biomedical Photonics Society) is a student-run organization that aims to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds with a passion for optics and photonics geared towards biomedical applications. Through a wide range of technical and social events, BiPS serves as a platform for the exchange of ideas, interdisciplinary research, and wider community engagement. BiPS hopes to foster a collaborative environment where members can form lasting connections to further their personal and professional goals.
